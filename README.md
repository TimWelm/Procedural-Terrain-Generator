# Procedural-Terrain-Generator
A program to procedurally generate two dimensional terrain using a line fractal algorithm. The program works by repeatedly splitting a line then displacing at the point of seperation by a random decreasing amount, then re-aligns the line as to keep a contionous structure. The project prints the generated terrain to the world.txt file in the project.

A demonstration of the kind of terrain this project can create can be found in the current world.txt file.
